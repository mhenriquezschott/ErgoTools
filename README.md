# JROT

The Job Rotation Optimization Tool (JROT) helps design and analyze job rotation schedules by estimating ergonomic risks for each worker across different jobs and time blocks. 
It leverages established fatigue failure tools (LiFFT, DUET, and ST) to quantify exposure and includes optimization features to minimize average and peak risks across rotations. 
JROT provides detailed visual tables with risk color coding, average calculations, and tailored suggestions to support the creation of more balanced, lower-risk job rotation schemes.
